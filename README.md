# mindhack-hackathon
It is an webpage for people who want to learn about mental health or who has mental health problems.
Firstly, this project is build using visual code studio. Basically we have used basic html and css with an add on of bootstrap. Bootstrap was used for the cards and the buttons. To install the project in your computer or laptop, you will have to download it as a code zip file. However we have posted our style css seperately. Hence in order to get the style in order, you must paste the contents of the style css in the depression html and the index html.
Then, you just have to open up the folder and click on the index.html to open up the website.
